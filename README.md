Guidance and best practices for Technical Integration with QIskit Runtime APIs

# Qiskit Runtime APIs
Qiskit Runtime is accessible via REST API through the following channels
* [IBM Quantum Platform (IQP) API](https://runtime-us-east.quantum-computing.ibm.com/openapi#/) 
* [IBM Cloud API](https://us-east.quantum-computing.cloud.ibm.com/openapi/)

 General documentation is available in both cases 
 * [IQP API documentation](https://docs.quantum-computing.ibm.com/api/runtime)
 * [IBM Cloud API documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/quantum-computing)

 Here, we aim to add guidance on recommended workflows for Integration projects using these APIs. This includes control over issued tokens and websocket queries for live updates for submitted jobs.
